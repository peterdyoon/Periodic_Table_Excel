# Periodic_Table_Excel
After learning HTML and CSS for 1.5 days, my instructor really wanted to drive home the idea of making tables through repetition. 

He handed us a picture of the Periodic Table, and I thought, "no way I'm doing this by hand." 

My background is in accounting and finance, so I looked to Microsoft Excel for assistance. I found a CSV online with information on the periodic table including names, atomic mass, atomic numbers, and elemental classes. The most important information on this file was the "positioning" of the elements in relation to today's Periodic Table. Using the information from this table, I was able to create HTML code class names for each part of the data. 

This process offered amazing results as I was guaranteed no spelling errors between HTML elements, better organization, and no repeatable tasks. In other words, I was ready for the world of programming. Although Excel may not be the most ideal method of coding, it certainly provided a solution to the headache of making an entire Periodic Table by scratch.
