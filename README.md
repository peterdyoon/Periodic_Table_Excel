# Periodic_Table_Excel
After learning HTML and CSS for 1.5 days, my instructor really wanted to drive home the idea of making tables through repetition. 

He handed us a picture of the Periodic Table, and I thought, "no way I'm doing this by hand." 

My background is in accounting and finance, so I looked to Microsoft Excel for assistance. I found a CSV online with information on the Periodic Table including names, atomic mass, atomic numbers, and elemental classes. The most important information on this file was the "positioning" of the elements in relation to today's Periodic Table; by viewing the table as an 18 by 9 table, I was able to create HTML code that had precise locations for each element. By the end of the process, I had one tab that contained details to the Periodic Table and another tab that contained details to the HTML code. For edits, rather than adjusting the HTML code, I could change details on the table which will cause automatic changes to my HTML code. In this project, vlookups saved my life!

This process offered amazing results as I was guaranteed no spelling errors between HTML elements, better organization, and no repeatable tasks. In other words, I was ready for the world of programming. Although Excel may not be the most ideal method of coding, it certainly provided a solution to the headache of making an entire Periodic Table by scratch.
